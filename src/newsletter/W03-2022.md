Hello everyone,

I hope you had a great and warm week! I'm done with all the cold 🥶 and hopefully next week will have some sun ☀️. Moreover, I tried a fun experiment of using Twitter without all the numbers(like, comment, followers, following, etc.) and to my surprise it was a much better twitter experience. If you also want to try it out, then I will recommend checking *[Minimal Twitter](https://wang.sh/minimal-twitter).*

> _A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse._

This is something I've learned the hard way after messing up so bad that I've no other place to move but to turn back and restart from scratch. Because I kept breaking things, I didn't understand until the moment I had no other option but to turn back and start from scratch.

Jason is spot on with this one and while we realize it or not setting good defaults in life or at work will make things much smoother and the output will be much better with less effort.
