Hello Everyone,

We already are in the ninth week of 2022 which also means that this is the penultimate edition of this newsletter as I promised myself that I'll be doing at least 10 editions for this one. These few editions have made me realize what I need to do more and what I don't, and thus with those things in mind I'll continue this on my website. With all this, let's get back to the usual stuff.
