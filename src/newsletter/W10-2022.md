Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 10th edition of this newsletter which, I thought, was going to be the last one, but I've decided to continue it as I like sharing this stuff with you all. So for my updates I'll be taking a vacation and will be writing next edition from Uttarakhand. And let's get on to the interesting stuff.

## **📚 To Read**

[_Run your day, don’t let the day run you_](https://www.kahlillechelt.com/blog/run-your-day-dont-let-the-day-run-you/)  
A fascinating read with an intriguing approach on how you organize your workflow to get the most out of your day.

[_Give Yourself Permission to Be Creative_](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2022/03/give-yourself-permission-to-be-creative-2.html)  
I rarely watch this sort of videos, but I really liked this one and loved the advice on trying something different, something new which you may love it, or you may not.

[_Are tech interviews broken — or is the cruelty the point?_](https://leftalign.substack.com/p/are-tech-interviews-broken-or-is)  
Loved reading the whole thing, and it might give you some insight on why tech interviews are the way they are, even if a lot of us feel they are broken.

[_Sci-Hub, the site for pirated academic papers, is on trial in India_](https://restofworld.org/2022/sci-hub-trial-india)  
This has brought me to think once again is piracy really that bad or there are some good things about it as well.

[_Say Hello to selectmenu, a Fully Style-able select Element_](https://css-tricks.com/the-selectmenu-element/)  
A new HTML element is coming which allows you to make custom dropdowns, and good news for every developer who has attempted to style the dropdown and eventually resorted to a popup of some sorts to only realize later that now they need to make it accessible as well.

[_How Websites Die_](https://notebook.wesleyac.com/how-websites-die/)  
It's something I wish had a more reliable solution, but this is a real issue, something which needs more attention. [_Wayback Machine_](https://archive.org/) does some things to maintain an archive of websites, but I feel that this is not enough and there should be some way by which people can ensure that their websites stay forever even when they are gone.

[_Goodreads lost all of my reviews_](https://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/goodreads-lost-all-my-data.html)  
Another one of those examples which screams own your content. If you're doing anything online maybe writing a review, blog, journal, etc. and you want that the content should always be there then always make sure that you always have a copy that you own yourself. No platform is going to stay forever and more importantly stupid things ~~can~~ will happen which can make you lose the content or make it in accessible to you.

[_Write Plain Text Files_](https://sive.rs/plaintext)  
Another fascinating viewpoint. To summarize, you should always note your stuff in plain text because that is one format that you can count on will work everywhere irrespective of platform or time.

[_The Joys and Sorrows of Maintaining a Personal Website_](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/joys-and-sorrows.html)  
I'm sure by this time if you have ever maintained a personal website then you probably know what to expect, and if not I will suggest you to read this.

[_on learning to be slow_](https://winnielim.org/journal/on-learning-to-be-slow/)  
An excellent approach on habit formation, one which I learned when I read Atomic Habits and has worked well for me for various things.

## **🔭 To Explore**

[_Should I deploy today_](https://shouldideploy.today/)  
I'm sure you will find it fascinating.

## **😃 Something that made me smile**

Amidst all the terrible pics and news from Ukraine, this puts my belief back into humanity and shows the beautiful side of humans.
